# Deployment

**Deployment is to copy the LEMP pre-packaged online to your Cloud Server**. For example, after the user subscribe LEMP on the Cloud Platform, the Platform will automatically copy the LEMP to the corresponding Cloud Server.

- If LEMP has been deployed, go to Initial Installation to complete the operation.
- If LEMP is not deployed, you need to deploy LEMP to your cloud server first.

We offer two deployment LEMP scenarios (the deployment results are the same):

## Deploy by Image

**Deploy by Image** means starting instance from LEMP images. **LEMP Image** provide OS and software environment needed for LEMP.

For users with experience with cloud servers, Deploy by Image equated with "one-click deployment".

Websoft9 published [LEMP image](https://apps.websoft9.com/lnmp) on Cloud Platform, three methods for your deployment:

* When **Create New Instance** , select the LEMP image as the system boot template.
* When **Subscribe LEMP** on Marketplace, the system will promote you to create a new instance for this image at the same time.
* When **Re-install OS** for you instance, you can replace the existing image with a LEMP image.

## Deploy by Script

**Deploy by Script** means running a script on your cloud instance to pull the pre-packages online to your instance and configure it at the same time.

Websoft9 provide the [LEMP ansbile automation script](https://github.com/Websoft9/ansible-lnmp) on Github. If you are familiar with Ansible, you can deploy the LEMP to the instance automaticly.

## Comparison

Although the results of the **deploy by image** are consistent with the results of **deploy by script**, what is the difference between the two deployment methods?
